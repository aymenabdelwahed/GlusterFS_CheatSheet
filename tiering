TIERING:
> Tiering = Classifying data = Defining data with a particular classification and moving said data based on the user's I/O access.
	>> Hot data placed on the higher performing hot tier (SSDs): treated as a cache for cold subvolume.
	>> Inactive data to a lower performing cold tier (Spinning disks) without any I/O interruption.
> When the activity level of data is identified, tiering uses the rebalance logic to relocate active and inactive data to the most appropriagte storage tier.

TIERING ARCHITECTURE:
> Tiering translator: is based on DHT and rebalance logic and splits a volume into two subvolumes, hot and cold.
> File migration occurs based on the following:
	- Temperature: the frequency with which the file is accessed
	- Capacity: the host subvolume's capacity (or watermark) has been reached
DATA MOVEMENT FRAMEWORK:
> The data movement framework is a generalization of the migration logic which leverages the rebalance logic. 
	The triggers to migrate a file are driven by the application.
	The files are either promoter or demoted to the appropriate tier.
	The frequency with which files are checked from promotion/demotion can be configured to suit specific glusterfs architectures.

> Data movement trigger: Is the mechanism that triggers the movement of a file from the Source Storage Unit to Destination Storage Unit.
	> The SSU and DSU specify the glusterfs brick/volume the data is being migration from to the glusterfs brick/volume on which data will reside.
	> The data movement trigger will create the Data Movement Request (DMR) which is submitted to the Data Movement Service (DMS) as well.
	> There are 2 triggers, the I/O Path Trigger and the Scanning Trigger
	-	I/O Path Trigger: When a file meets a specified data movement rule this trigger is initiated
	-	Scanner Trigger: Depending on the specified movement rule, the scanner trigger selects objects/files as it walks through the Specified Source Unit. After selecting an object/file, a DMR is submitted to the DMS.

> Data Movement Service (DMS): is responsible for the actual movement of data and for processing the request. This service receives a DMR submitted by the DataMovementTriggers. 

>>>>> Data Movement Trigger: Determine promotion/demotion of data
>>>>> Data Movement Plug-in: Identify and selelect concerned file for movement..

EXTENDING A TIERED VOLUME:
> Tiered volumes allow adding additional bricks to both the cold/hot tiers.
// Add a new brick to the cold tier
	// Detach the hot tier from the volume for which the cold-tier is going to be expanced with new bricks
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach start
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach commit
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach status
	//Add the new brick to the cold-tier:
	gluster volume add-brick demo-vol demo2:/bricks/brick1 demo2:/bricks/brick2
	//Rebalance the volume:
	gluster volume rebalance demo-vol start
	gluster volume rebalance demo-vol status
	//Re-attach the hot tier to the volume:
	gluster volume tier demo-vol attach replica 2 demo2:/bricks/brick1 demo2:/bricks/brick2

//Add a new brick to the hot tier:
	//detach the hot tier first:
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach start
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach commit
	//Re-attach the hot tier including both the old and new bricks
	gluster volume tier demo-vol attach replica 2 demo-a:/bricks/brick-a2/brick demo-a:/bricks/brick-a3/brick demo-b:/bricks/brick-b2/brick demo-b:/bricks/brick-b3/brick

SHRINKING A TIERED VOLUME:
> Both the cold and hot tier of a volume can be shrunk
	//Detach the soon to be shrunk
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach start
	gluster volume tier demo-vol detach commit
	//Remove the bricks
	gluster volume remove-brick demo-vol demo2:/bricks1 start
	gluster volume remove-brick demo-vol demo2:/bricks1 commit
	//Re-attach the hot tier
	gluster volume tier demo-vol attach replica 2 demo2:/bricks/brick1 demo2:/bricks/brick2

PROMOTE/DEMOTE FILES
//Configure Promotion/demotions
	//Configure watermarks, which used to classify file to be promoted or demoted
	cluster.watermark-hi
	cluster.watermark-lo
	>>> If DataUsage of the hot tier is under "cluster.watermark.lo" (75% by default) > Files can only be promoted
	>>> If DataUsage of the hot tier is above "cluster.watermark.hi" (90% by default) > files can only be demoted

//Configuring Promotion/demotion frequencies:
	//How often files are promoted/demoted can be controlled with 2 settings:
	cluster.tier-promote-frequency (default 120s)
	cluster.tier-demote-frequency (default 3600s)
	>>> If data has been accessed at least once in the last "cluster.tier-promote-frequency" > Data is promoted
	>>> If data has not been accessed in the last "" cluster.tier-demote-frequency" > Data becomes eligible for demotion

	//It's also possible to configure the minium number of reads/writes to mark a file as host:
	- cluster.read-freq-threshold (Default 0)[values between 0-1000]
	- cluster.write-freq-threshold(Default 0)[values between 0-1000]
	> A value from 1 to 1000 indicates the minimum number of times a file must be accessed in order to become eligible for promotion

//Limiting data movement:
	Limit the amount of data that is moved between the hot and the cold tier can be limited to:
	- cluster.tier-max-files: (default to 10000 files to be moved during a single cycle)
	- cluster.tier-max-mb: (default to 4000MiB of data to be moved during a single cycle)
