TIERING:
> Tiering = Classifying data = Defining data with a particular classification and moving said data based on the user's I/O access.
	>> Hot data placed on the higher performing hot tier (SSDs): treated as a cache for cold subvolume.
	>> Inactive data to a lower performing cold tier (Spinning disks) without any I/O interruption.
> When the activity level of data is identified, tiering uses the rebalance logic to relocate active and inactive data to the most appropriagte storage tier.

TIERING ARCHITECTURE:
> Tiering translator: is based on DHT and rebalance logic and splits a volume into two subvolumes, hot and cold.
> File migration occurs based on the following:
	- Temperature: the frequency with which the file is accessed
	- Capacity: the host subvolume's capacity (or watermark) has been reached
DATA MOVEMENT FRAMEWORK:
> The data movement framework is a generalization of the migration logic which leverages the rebalance logic. 
	The triggers to migrate a file are driven by the application.
	The files are either promoter or demoted to the appropriate tier.
	The frequency with which files are checked from promotion/demotion can be configured to suit specific glusterfs architectures.

> Data movement trigger: Is the mechanism that triggers the movement of a file from the Source Storage Unit to Destination Storage Unit.
	> The SSU and DSU specify the glusterfs brick/volume the data is being migration from to the glusterfs brick/volume on which data will reside.
	> The data movement trigger will create the Data Movement Request (DMR) which is submitted to the Data Movement Service (DMS) as well.
	> There are 2 triggers, the I/O Path Trigger and the Scanning Trigger
	-	I/O Path Trigger: When a file meets a specified data movement rule this trigger is initiated
	-	Scanner Trigger: Depending on the specified movement rule, the scanner trigger selects objects/files as it walks through the Specified Source Unit. After selecting an object/file, a DMR is submitted to the DMS.

> Data Movement Service (DMS): is responsible for the actual movement of data and for processing the request. This service receives a DMR submitted by the DataMovementTriggers. 

>>>>> Data Movement Trigger: Determine promotion/demotion of data
>>>>> Data Movement Plug-in: Identify and selelect concerned file for movement..

EXTENDING A TIERED VOLUME:
> Tiered volumes allow adding additional bricks to both the cold/hot tiers.
// Add a new brick to the cold tier
	// Detach the hot tier from the volume for which the cold-tier is going to be expanced with new bricks

	//Rebalance the volume:

	//Re-attach the hot tier to the volume:
