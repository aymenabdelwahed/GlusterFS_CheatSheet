NATIVE CLIENTS:
Native client is built around the FUSE technology (File System in Userspace) and supports POSIX ACLs and automatic failover.
Native client is the recommended way, and doesn't rely on any single host being available.
Native client communicates directly with the different bricks in the volume.
	//Install Fuse
	yum install glusterfs-fuse
	//Update clients (Unmount any mounted volumes during the update process)
	yum update glusterfs glusterfs-fuse
Native client mount options are:
	- backup-volfile-servers=<SERVER1>:<SERVER2>: Fallback to server2 in case of server1 unreacheable issues are encountred.
	- ro: Mount the volume as ReadOnly
	- acl: Enable POSIX ACLs on this volume. Using native client, ACLs can be both enforced and set.
	- _netdev: Used by the system startup logic (not by the native client) > Volume will not be mounted until after networking has been started.

Manually mount a volume using POSIX ACLs:
	# mount.glusterfs -o acl storage-server:/volume /mnt/volume
Mounting a volume even when the host specified is unreachable:
	vim /etc/fstab
	storage-server-1:/volume /mnt/volume glusterfs _netdev,backup-volfile-servers=storage-server-2:storage-server-3 0 0

NFS CLIENT:
By default, any new Gluster volume will be exported over NFSv3, with ACLs enabled and this from all servers. >> Allow 2 services through firewall (nfs and rpc-bind)
	> Allows clients that can't run the native client to access shared data..
	> Unlike FUSE, not automatic fail over to using another server will be done..

	//Configure firewall on the server side
	firewall-cmd --add-service nfs --add-service=rpc-bind --permanent
	firewall-cmd --reload

	//Install NFS client:
	yum install nfs-utils
	//Mount NFS (Specify NFS v3)
	mount -t nfs -o vers=3,proto=tcp servera:/mediadata /mnt/mediadata
	//Add to fstab
	echo "servera:/mediadata /mnt/mediadata nfs rw,vers=3,proto=tcp 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
	mount -a; df -hT

CIFS CLIENT/SERVER:
Gluster supports exporting volumes over the SMB protocol using Samba 4.
> Lors de l'utilisation du plug-in samba-vfs-glusterfs, il n'est pas nécessaire de monter les volumes sur le serveur exportant le partage samba, car le plug-in vfs utilise l'API GlusterFS pour accéder directement aux données.
//Prepare a Gluster Server to export volumes using SMB:
	//Install Samba package (both of Samba 4 and VFS plugin for direct volume access)
	yum install samba
	//Start Samba service
	systemctl start smb.service; systemctl enable smb.service
	//Open the Samba service
	firewall-cmd --add-service smb --permanent && firewall-cmd --reload
//Configure a Volume to e exported using Samba:
	//Disable "stat-prefetch" for the volume that needs to be exported: (Can cause issues over samba and accessing from other clients at the same time)
	gluster volume set <VOLUME> stat-prefetch off
	//Allow communication with the bricks that make up this volume from unprivileged ports
	gluster volume set <VOLUME> server.allow-insecure on
	//Set the fsync delay for the volume to zero microseconds, to ensure proper lock and I/O coherency:
	gluster volume set <VOLUME> storage.batch-fsync-delay-usec 0
	//Restart the volume; This will trigger the hook script "/var/lib/glusterd/hooks/1/post/S30samba-start.sh which will adds an export to /etc/samba/smb.conf
	gluster volume stop mediadata && gluster volume start mediadata
	//Check if the share was added to samba automatically = which allow samba to automatically talk to our volume whithout having to mount something on any machine...
	grep -A 10 gluster-mediadata /etc/samba/smb.conf
	//Configure Glusterd daemon to allow communication from unprivileged ports:
	vim /etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol
		option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on
	systemctl restart glusterd.service

//Configure Clients:
	//Install samba-client: gives the smbclient commands, which provides the possibility to talk to samba without having to mount a volume..
	//Install cifs-utils: to be able to mount a CIFS FileSystem
	yum install samba-client cifs-utils

	//Check what's available on servera:
	smbclient -L servera -U smbuser%redhat

SMB Clients process:
	 Red Hat Gluster Storage volumes exported using samba will have the name gluster-<VOLNAME>, and can be used the same way as any other samba share. This means specifying the cifs file system type, and specifying either a user= and pass= mount option, or a credentials= mount option. If neither of these options is used the mount command will ask for credentials during the mount process, which is most likely not wanted for automated mounts from /etc/fstab. 

//Disable automated sharing for volumes:
	//Set either of user.cifs or user.smb to disable
	gluster volume set <VOLNAME> user.cifs disable
